"""Shared vocabulary for the commit core (PLAN.md section 3.2).

This module is THE single source for enum vocabularies (PLAN.md section 10,
point 5): the ``commit_records`` DDL CHECK lists in ``airlock.store._schema``
are *generated from* these enums, and a CI test asserts the live database
constraints match them. Never retype these value lists anywhere else —
divergence between the API, the DDL, and (later) the event schema was the
single biggest failure mode found in design review.

P1.1 defined the commit-ledger types; P1.2 adds ``Verification`` (the probe
vocabulary); P2.1 adds the policy vocabulary (``Decision``, ``Reversibility``,
``BlastRadius``, ``Money``). Later phases add the remaining section 3.2 rows
(``PauseStatus`` in P2.3) to this same module.
